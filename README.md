### Hi there :relaxed:

<!-- Welcome to my github page. -->
My name is Maria.

I am a machine learning engineer with extensive experience in research.

I am passionate about both: science and programming and I am sharing those passions through various channels (teaching, Native Scientist, Software Carpentry and of course Pyladies).

I am an organizer of Pyladies Paris, come and join us at one of the events: [Pyladies Paris](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/pyladiesparis/)
